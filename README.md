# STAT-632-Final-Project
Final Project for Graduate-Level Linear and Logistic Regression  
Includes data cleaning and wrangling, EDA, visuals and ANOVA.


For this project I used a Multiple Linear Regression model on precipitation time-series data collected at stations in the Eastern Sierra Nevada to predict stream runoff into nearby lakes.

The project yielded a model with a high coefficient of correlation, and none of the assumptions of linear regression were violated in model selection--however, in future studies I would alter model to address issues of autocorrelation. Due to the spatial relationship between precipitation stations, predictor variables are somewhat redundant; nearby stations will yield similar precipitation measurements and outputs into the streams. 

Consequently, I would consider reducing the number of precipitation stations and increasing variables that impact the measurement water in other stages of the hydrologic cycle, such as evapotranspiration measurements, climatic data, physical geographic data,amongst others.
